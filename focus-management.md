Deep Work, as defined by Cal Newport, is the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks, allowing for the creation of high-value work and faster skill development in a world filled with distractions.

## How to do deep work according to Cal Newport:

1. **Schedule focus time**: Set specific times for uninterrupted work.
1. **Remove distractions**: Avoid social media and email while working.
1. **Follow a routine**: Create habits or rituals that prepare you to focus.
1. **Set clear goals**: Know exactly what you want to achieve in each session.
1. **Get used to boredom**: Practice staying focused without needing distractions.
1. **Limit easy tasks**: Spend less time on shallow tasks like emails.
