    ## Review Questions

### Question 1
**Which point(s) were new to you?**

-  The emphasis on over-communicating in scenarios like missed deadlines, outages, or technical difficulties stood out as new. I hadn’t realized how important it is to proactively communicate in such situations.
- The suggestion to use tools like loom or Codepen to provide visual explanations for questions was also a new practice for me. It seems like a great way to make it easier for others to understand issues.
- The practice of sharing all questions in one message rather than sending multiple short messages is also a great idea I hadn't considered before.

### Question 2
**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

- I need to improve in "Doing things with 100% involvement." Sometimes, I get distracted by my phone or other social media platforms during work hours.
  
  **Ideas to make progress:**
  - I plan to use tools like Freedom to block social media sites during work hours.
  - I'll turn off non-work-related notifications and keep my phone on silent mode to minimize distractions.
  - I can also use a time-tracking app like Boosted to ensure I’m spending my time productively.
  - Consistent exercise will help maintain energy levels throughout the day, so I will add short workouts to my routine.
