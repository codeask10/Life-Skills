# Learning Process

## Feynman Technique:
- The Feynman Technique is a **four-step** process developed by **Richard Feynman** to learn any subject—no matter how hard or complex it is.

## Most Interesting Idea from the Video

The most interesting idea for me was the concept of **Understanding with Practice and Repetition**. I follow this approach in my learning process as it emphasizes actively applying knowledge and reinforcing it through consistent practice. It helps me retain information for the long term and ensures a deeper understanding of the material. By testing myself regularly, I can identify areas of improvement and continuously strengthen my learning.

## Active Mode/Focus

In active mode, I am fully focused on something, like studying or solving a problem. My brain works hard to learn or figure things out step by step.

Example: When I am focused on learning a new programming concept.

## Diffused Mode
In diffused mode, I am more relaxed, and my brain works in the background, making connections and thinking creatively. I am not focusing directly, but my brain is still processing information.

Example: When I come up with a solution while taking a walk or relaxing.

## steps to take when approaching a new topic:

-   Deconstruct the skill

-   Learn Enough to self-correct

-   Remove practice barriers

-   Practice at least 20 hours

## Actions to Improve My Learning Process

-   I will try to learn new concepts using the Feynman Technique, which involves teaching what I learn to others in simple terms.
-   I will focus on understanding topics through practice and repetition to reinforce my knowledge.
-   I'll follow these four steps to learn new concepts effectively:
    - Deconstruct the skill: Break the skill into smaller, manageable parts.
    - Learn enough to self-correct: Gain just enough knowledge to identify and fix  mistakes.
    - Remove practice barriers: Eliminate distractions or obstacles that prevent consistent practice.
    - Practice for at least 20 hours: Commit to focused, consistent practice.

-   I’ll also follow the principle: "Work when I work, play when I play", staying fully present in each activity.
-   Additionally, I’ll use the Pomodoro Technique to improve focus and productivity by working in timed intervals with regular breaks.
