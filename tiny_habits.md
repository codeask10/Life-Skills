# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### Most interesting story or idea

The most interesting idea in BJ Fogg's talk is how tiny habits can lead to big changes. He shares a story about doing just two push-ups after using the bathroom, which later grew into a bigger exercise routine. The point is: start small, and it gets easier to build good habits.

## 2. B=MAP - BJ Fogg

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

**Formula: B = MAP**
- **B** = **Behavior**: The habit or action you want to create.
- **M**= **Motivation** : How much you want to do the behavior.
- **A** = **Ability**: How easy or hard it is to do the behavior.
- **P** = **Prompt**: The trigger or reminder that prompts the behavior.

### Example Routine to Master DSA Using B = MAP:

1. **Behavior**: Solve five problem per day (or spend 60 minutes learning a concept).

1. **Motivation**: I am aiming to get better at coding interviews and improve my programming skills.
1. **Ability**: Start with an easy task (one problem or 10 minutes of study).
1. **Prompt**:Solve problem after dinner.

### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
BJ Fogg says celebrating after a habit is important because it makes me feel good. When 
I feel good, my brain remembers the habit better. This means i am more likely to do it again. In simple terms, whatever I celebrate becomes a habit!

## 3. 1% Better Every Day

### Interesting Story/Idea:

One powerful story Clear shares is about the British cycling team. For years, they were mediocre, but when they started making small improvements in various areas—like better nutrition, improved sleep, and even the design of their bikes—they gradually became world-class. This transformation highlights how focusing on small changes in multiple areas can lead to significant success over time.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### Identity

In Atomic Habits, James Clear emphasizes that identity is central to habit formation. He argues that lasting change comes from changing how you see yourself. Instead of focusing solely on goals, you should adopt an identity that aligns with the habits you want to develop (e.g., “I am a runner” instead of “I want to run”). This identity shift helps reinforce positive behaviors and makes it easier to stick with new habits.

### In Atomic Habits, James Clear suggests making habits easier by:

1. **Reducing Friction**: Remove obstacles that make it hard to start the habit.
1. **Using the Two-Minute Rule**: Start with a habit that takes less than two minutes to do.
1. **Optimizing Your Environment**: Arrange your space to make good habits more convenient.
1. **Automating**: Use reminders or tools to help you stick to the habit.
1. **Habit Stacking**: Link a new habit to an existing one.

### In Atomic Habits, James Clear suggests making bad habits harder to do by:

1. **Increasing Friction**: Add obstacles to make the habit more difficult. For example, keep junk food out of your home.

1. **Use Commitment Devices**: Create consequences for not following through on your habits, like setting a penalty if you skip a workout.

1. **Change Your Environment**: Remove triggers that prompt the bad habit, such as avoiding places where you usually engage in it.

1. **Make It Invisible**: Limit exposure to cues that lead to the bad habit, like unfollowing social media accounts that encourage procrastination.
